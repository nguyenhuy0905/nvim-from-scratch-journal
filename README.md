# Neovim from scratch

> A journal of my (not too difficult) journey to set up Neovim from scratch.

## Some disclaimers

- I'm not new to Neovim or the setup process. So, while it is indeed my first time
setting up Neovim from scratch, it's not like it's my first time configuring Neovim.

## Where is the setup?

- See it on [my Dotfile repo](https://github.com/nguyenhuy0905/my-dotfile).

## Chapters

- First config files and plugins [read here](./first-steps/first-init-file.md)
